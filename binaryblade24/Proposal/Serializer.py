Proposal Serializers Module

This module contains serializers for handling proposal-related data transformations
and API representations in the BinaryBlade24 freelancing platform.

Key Features:
- Public profile information exposure only (no email/phone)
- Nested project information for proposal context
- Read-only bid amount (auto-populated from project budget)
- Platform-only communication enforcement
