Proposal Views Module

This module handles all API endpoints related to proposal submission, listing,
and status management in the BinaryBlade24 freelancing platform.

Core Functionality:
- Freelancers can submit proposals to OPEN projects
- Clients can view and manage proposals for their projects
- Secure proposal status updates with transaction integrity
- Role-based access control for proposal data

API Endpoints:
- POST   /api/projects/{project_id}/proposals/       - Submit proposal
- GET    /api/projects/{project_id}/proposals/       - List project proposals
- PATCH  /api/projects/{project_id}/proposals/{id}/status/ - Update proposal status
- GET    /api/proposals/{id}/                        - Retrieve single proposal
- GET    /api/users/{user_id}/proposals/             - List user's proposals
